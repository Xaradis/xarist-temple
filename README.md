Dev origin story of boot.dev/github


Hello my names Michael Aig, I have a bachelors degree in economics and I love video games.
 These two things join quite nicely in some of the games I've played over the years like path of exile or various MMO's.
 Recently however I've moved on to playing more time conscientious games like single player ones.
 Preferably games with fantastical stories or immersive worlds EX:(Baldurs gate/Elden Ring).
 If I'm not gaming I enjoy swimming but mainly cause it's really hot in Texas and you've gotta find someway to cool off.
